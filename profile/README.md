## Your partner for high-resolution, high speed digitizers and AWGs

Spectrum Instrumentation GmbH specializes in the production of high speed digitizers, arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs) and digital I/O products designed for various standards such as PCIe (PCI Express), PXIe or the Ethernet-based LXI. Our high speed digitizer portfolio – over 100 different products also known as A/D or DAQ cards and PC oscilloscopes – covers the medium and high-speed ranges with sampling rates between 5 MS/s and 5 GS/s. The bandwidth can reach more than 1 GHz.

Spectrum Instrumentation's arbitrary waveform generators excel with high channel densities that far surpass standard signal generators, all at a very good price/performance ratio. Our AWGs are available with output rates ranging from 40 MS/s to 1.25 GS/s and bandwidths that can exceed 500 MHz.

All of our high speed digitizers, AWGs and digital I/O products are designed for high continuous data throughput and can be used to create streaming systems with continuous, gapless recording in the GHz range. Spectrum Instrumentation's PCIe product line is the most comprehensive of its kind on the market. Products based on PXIe are also available for industrial systems with the same performance. The LXI products, based on the GBit Ethernet standard, can be connected to a company network and used remotely.
